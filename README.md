# INFO 343 Final Project
### Goal: Create an arcade styled web application 
### Summary
Our team plans to build an arcade styled web application that features three games. 
These games are Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4, and a variation of 20 Questions. These games 
will be played between two players on a local machine. We plan on building this project
as a React application that utilizes Firebase to authenticate players and store game data
for each player. This application will also include a leaderboard view that allows our 
players to view game statistics for our entire player base.

### Responsibilities
To structure our project, we plan on using the issues feature on GitHub to prioritize 
which parts of our project needs to completed first. The first few issues will be setting
up our repository and making sure we have all the basic necessities before proceeding.
Then, the current plan is to have a team member be responsible for the development of each 
individual game of our web application. The remaining team member will be responsible for 
developing the infrastructure of the web application like the navigation between game modes, 
user authentication, and the leaderboard display. We then plan on collaboratively styling
our application to achieve a cohesive design for our web application.
